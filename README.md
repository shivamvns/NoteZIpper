# NoteZipper
 
With the help of "MERN Stack", i have build a superb Note taking App called "NoteZipper", in which a user can register themself and after registration user will have to log in themself for creating notes and and there is also a my profile section in which logged in user's name, email and a profile picture is shown(user can upload in registration page) and the complete login/registration route is protected with JWT authentication and the passwords are totatty hashed before saving in database(Mongodb)
